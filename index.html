In the video, Mayuko discusses the need for soft skills in the life of a software engineer. 
<ul>
<li>Examples of soft skills include:</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>listening</li>
<li>Teamwork</li>
<li>Problem solving</li>
<li>work ethic</li>
</ul>
In the syllabus, it talks about how working with a partner can be very beneficial even if someone does not like working with other people. I am a big proponent of working with people as I feel like it helps to talk to someone about the problem you are attempting to find an answer to. Peer assessments go a long way in building communication and finding out things your peers are doing that maybe you would like to improve your work in. Computer scientists are also steriotyped as being antisocial and someone that just sits at their desk all day. Obviously that is not true because computer scientists eventually have problems they do not have the answer to so they need to communicate with their coworkers and find the solution. As a computer scientist it is your job to find the mistakes in software, and peer editing makes that a lot easier than if you are doing that yourself.

Also in the video, Mayuko discusses being true to yourself. Learing your own strengths and weaknesses is key to becoming the best software engineer you can possibly be. It also helps when assessing your peers' assignments because you can figure out some of their strengths and weaknesses and help them out if they are struggling with finding their own.
